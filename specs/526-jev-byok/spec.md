# Feature specification: Jev email triage

Updated: 2026-09-29. Status: implementation approved; owner-matched runtime acceptance pending.
Tracking: [ENG-11](https://linear.app/matrix-os/issue/ENG-11), [OM-286](https://linear.app/matrix-os/issue/OM-286), [GitHub #1800](https://github.com/HamedMP/matrix-os/issues/1800), [spec PR #1812](https://github.com/HamedMP/matrix-os/pull/1812).

The team narrowed the first milestone from ENG-11's earlier three-recipe and generic `use-jevs` proposal to this one Gmail workflow. [ENG-11's current scope](https://linear.app/matrix-os/issue/ENG-11/jev-inbox-triage-recipe-via-matrix-ai-gateway) explicitly supersedes that 2026-09-21 proposal; the research and routing recipes and generic skill remain follow-up scope. The initial demo and release acceptance are read-only: no unattended label or archive mutation is accepted. The implementation may offer a separately requested, action-specific Gmail write after explicit user authorization or an existing automation grant, but neither creating the bot nor receiving a Jev result grants that authority.

## Product scope

Ship one production-quality Jev workflow for Gmail inbox triage. Matrix supplies Jev through its existing Cloudflare-backed AI relay; users do not enter a TypeSafe, Cloudflare or Vercel key. The user's primary coding or conversational model remains unchanged, while Jev calls use the authenticated owner's Matrix AI eligibility and credits.

The capability has three explicit layers:

1. The Matrix Jev Gateway authenticates the runtime, meters the request, resolves a versioned recipe, bounds work, calls Jev, validates the result and returns a typed response.
2. The immutable `email-triage-v1` recipe defines seven independent Boolean questions and their output contract.
3. A Gateway recipe broker binds the owner's selected Gmail account in the saved bot, verifies the pinned connection with a live Gmail `get_profile` before each mailbox read, bounds one selected thread, and constructs Jev evidence and deterministic proposals. The bundled `matrix-jev-email-triage` skill guides the interaction but cannot grant mailbox or Jev authority.
4. The Matrix Agent Recipes market includes a Jev Inbox Triage card. **Build in Chat** creates a reusable Hermes bot using the current user's authenticated Agent API and Gmail connection from Services, verifies that the bot appears in that user's Agent library with the selected Gmail account, then opens it in Chat. Users do not author a setup prompt.

Jev classifies. It never receives action authority and never directly mutates Gmail. The first acceptance milestone returns read-only proposals only. A separate future milestone must review any label or archive action under explicit authorization.

The initial security PR is an intermediate prerequisite: it saves a server-stamped owner/account binding and **rejects Jev-bot invocation before a harness, primary inference, Gmail, or Jev starts**, with a safe unavailable result. The scoped bearer seam is preparation for the later broker; it does not itself isolate a model with shell access. Native Hermes currently inherits the Gateway process environment, and a host-service child may run as the same `matrix` user that can read `/opt/matrix/env/host.env`. Therefore the Jev workflow must remain blocked until the functional phase proves credential, file, and process isolation (or a supported restricted no-shell harness tool mode) as well as bounded Pipedream read transport. Environment scrubbing is defense in depth, not that proof. This PR is not a claim that inbox triage works or is ready to deploy alone. The functional phase must still support a bounded snippet pass and, when verification is needed, the latest four messages of the one selected thread; a snippet-only release does not satisfy this specification.

Gateway composition extraction plan: `server.ts` currently assembles the Chat route's stores, provider catalog, and integration lookup in a large startup function. Keep PR1's account-resolution logic in `chat/jev-recipe-authority.ts` and its route handoff in `server/collaboration-chat-routes.ts`. After the stacked MCP authority changes land, extract the Chat dependency assembly into a focused `server/collaboration-chat-composition.ts` with typed owner-inventory inputs and explicit startup ordering. Preserve the proxy-only customer VPS path and its timeout/cap tests while moving the wiring; do not combine this refactor with PR1's fail-closed authority change.

The original directory name `526-jev-byok` is retained for review-link continuity. Personal Jev keys are not in scope.

## User scenarios and testing

### User story 1 — Classify an inbox safely (Priority: P1)

A user asks Matrix to organize a connected Gmail inbox. Matrix reads recent or changed inbox threads, evaluates each thread against the seven recipe questions and shows the proposed labels before any mailbox mutation that is not already covered by an explicitly authorized automation.

**Independent test**: Given fixed Gmail thread fixtures, one real or contract-equivalent Gateway call returns all seven bounded probabilities in one response, and the deterministic policy produces the expected multi-label result without sending, deleting or replying to email.

**Acceptance scenarios**:

1. **Given** a recent direct question from an existing contact, **when** the recipe returns strong `needs_reply` evidence, **then** Matrix proposes the Needs reply label; a separately authorized write may apply it.
2. **Given** an email matching more than one category, **when** thresholds are met, **then** Matrix proposes multiple labels rather than forcing a single category.
3. **Given** a borderline score, snippet-only evidence or malformed response, **when** confidence is insufficient for the requested action, **then** Matrix proposes Review and does not archive.
4. **Given** a verified high-confidence cold outreach thread with no conflicting urgent, personal, investment or recruiting signal, **when** archiving is already authorized, **then** Matrix removes only the Gmail `INBOX` label.
5. **Given** missing authorization, insufficient Matrix AI credit or unavailable Jev service, **when** triage runs, **then** Matrix reports the safe failure and makes no Gmail changes for the affected thread.

### User story 2 — Use the recipe from a supported coding agent (Priority: P1)

A user invokes `matrix-jev-email-triage` in a supported coding agent. The skill discovers the Matrix integration tools, reads the connected Gmail account, calls the shared Jev recipe and follows the same deterministic policy as other Matrix runtimes.

**Independent test**: A clean supported-agent session discovers the skill and Jev tool without a personal Jev key, then completes one fixture-backed classification through the real Matrix invocation path.

**Acceptance scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user's primary model uses a personal provider account, **when** the skill calls Jev, **then** only the Jev step uses Matrix AI access and the primary provider selection is unchanged.
2. **Given** multiple Gmail accounts, **when** the user did not identify one, **then** bot creation asks which connected account to bind and persists that selection.
3. **Given** a saved Gmail selection, **when** the live `get_profile` email for that selected integration is missing or differs, **then** the skill stops before any message search or read and reports the mismatch.
3. **Given** email content containing instructions for the agent, **when** the skill prepares the state, **then** those instructions remain untrusted evidence and are never executed.

### User story 3 — Resume incremental triage without duplicate work (Priority: P2)

After a successful run, Matrix can process only new or changed Gmail threads and avoid duplicate paid evaluation or repeated mailbox actions.

**Independent test**: Replaying the same mailbox, thread and content fingerprint returns the same completed classification and performs no second upstream dispatch or label mutation.

**Acceptance scenarios**:

1. **Given** an unchanged processed thread, **when** a later run sees it again, **then** Matrix skips classification and mailbox mutation.
2. **Given** a changed thread, **when** its fingerprint differs, **then** Matrix evaluates the updated bounded state using the same recipe version.
3. **Given** an expired Gmail history cursor, **when** incremental discovery fails, **then** Matrix falls back to a bounded inbox rescan without treating every thread as automatically actionable.

## Functional requirements

### Configured Hermes primary models (ENG-40)

The Inbox bot remains a Hermes bot. Its isolated execution mode protects the mailbox and broker authority; it does not require an additional Anthropic account. The first expansion supports the existing owner Anthropic API-key route, Hermes's configured OpenAI API or OpenRouter API-key route, and Hermes's own OpenAI Codex subscription login. OpenRouter model IDs retain their provider prefix and slash. This is Codex as a model provider within Hermes, not a Codex harness bot.

Creation and editing expose only the current supported Hermes selection. The server validates the same route family when saving, and revalidates the exact configured provider/model, fresh native authentication observation, owner, and saved enablement before starting a run. Existing unsupported saved bots remain readable and can be repaired by selecting a supported Hermes route; their old choice never authorizes execution.

For native routes the server reads bounded, non-symlink default-profile config and the exact selected credential only. It does not execute owner config, hooks, key commands, Python startup files, or copy the profile. Custom endpoints, named profiles, ambiguous credential pools, other OAuth providers, and managed primary-model routes require separate verified adapters and are not advertised by this expansion. These limitations do not change Gateway-funded Jev access.

A normal `hermes auth add openai-codex` device login may store its access grant only in the default profile's credential pool. Admit a single explicit OAuth device-login entry or the legacy provider singleton with matching pool aliases; multiple pool-only accounts, mismatched aliases, custom endpoints and expiring grants fail closed. The server reads the selected grant without changing the owner's auth store or importing its refresh grant into the child.

Fresh native login/configuration can initialize an untouched generated Hermes default and expose its current supported model in Settings. It must not borrow a shared Anthropic/Codex account, promote local observation to verified provider access, or override a saved owner configuration (including an explicit Off switch). Stale or absent native evidence cannot establish a runnable default. The exact credential and native route are still checked again before each restricted run.

The pinned Hermes model-options contract omits `auth_type` on built-in rows. A unique, explicitly non-user-defined `openai-api`, `openrouter`, or `openai-codex` row can identify the expected credential kind; absent custom-provider evidence must not become a generic OAuth default. Native readiness remains an observation, and admission still requires the exact bounded owner credential files and configured route. The public contracts entrypoint must also load under native Node without a TypeScript loader, because the sole-broker MCP launcher uses that runtime.

The child uses an exclusive private HOME/HERMES_HOME, fixed official endpoint and protocol, no fallback providers, no auxiliary inference, and the sole native `jev_inbox_preview` broker tool. It uses the pinned SDK's explicit-credential path and validates native session provider, model, and nonlazy sole tool catalog before prompt submission. A Codex subscription projects only a fresh access token, with at least 120 seconds remaining at admission. It never copies or rotates the owner's refresh token or imports another CLI's login; expired/revoked credentials stop and require owner reauthentication through Hermes. Primary-model failure cannot select another account, provider, or payer.

No new endpoint or authorization method is introduced. The existing authenticated Agent API owns saved selection; the run-scoped broker capability owns Inbox operations; the executing owner's Matrix funded policy and ledger own Jev charges. Primary-model inference uses the selected personal account independently of Jev funding. No Gmail write is enabled.

Validation must record failing-first route regressions, legacy Anthropic coverage, native credential isolation, expiry/account/model/provider mismatch failures, zero alternate dispatch after failure, the real pinned SDK explicit-key behavior, and actual Electron Desktop connectivity against an exact-head Preview VPS or isolated local Linux runtime. A broker or SDK fixture pass is not live provider or mailbox acceptance. Attach privacy-safe screenshots and exact runtime/build provenance to [ENG-40](https://linear.app/matrix-os/issue/ENG-40).

- **FR-001**: All Jev inference MUST use the Matrix Jev Gateway and the authenticated executing owner's Matrix AI authority. Agent inputs MUST NOT select a payer, API key or upstream endpoint.
- **FR-002**: Jev access MUST remain independent of the primary model's selected provider or account.
- **FR-003**: The Gateway MUST resolve a server-owned immutable recipe name/version and reject unknown recipes.
- **FR-004**: `email-triage-v1` MUST evaluate `urgent`, `cold_outreach`, `recruiting`, `investment`, `personal_intro`, `newsletter` and `needs_reply` as seven independent Boolean probabilities in one Jev request.
- **FR-005**: The Gateway MUST validate that all seven answers exist and contain finite probabilities from 0 through 1 before returning success.
- **FR-006**: A successful response MUST include a request identifier, recipe name/version, model identity, latency, validated answers and available usage/cost metadata without exposing credentials.
- **FR-006a**: A new versioned Jev authorization MUST bind the reviewed pricing-version identifier before dispatch. An exact settlement MUST retain the strictly parsed upstream `jev-*` resolved model and matching pricing version with the authoritative reservation and preserve the public `typesafe/jev` model identity. Historical results and reservations without provenance remain readable and MUST NOT be backfilled with guessed versions; unknown outcomes still require evidence-based manual reconciliation.
- **FR-007**: The request MUST include an idempotency key derived from owner-scoped mailbox, thread and content identity. Duplicate completed requests MUST NOT trigger another paid dispatch, including after the stored result expires; a pruned result returns a distinct safe expiry error.
- **FR-008**: Gateway work MUST be bounded by request/response limits, timeout, concurrency and rate limits. Retries MUST be bounded and MUST NOT repeat a request whose upstream billing outcome is unknown, including after result-data retention and process restart.
- **FR-009**: Upstream 429 or explicit retryable failures MAY be retried with bounded backoff under the same logical request. Final failure MUST remain visible and MUST NOT be represented as a classification.
- **FR-010**: Raw email bodies, provider credentials and Matrix runtime credentials MUST NOT appear in normal logs. Operational logs MAY include request ID, owner-safe runtime reference, recipe/version, status, latency and bounded usage/cost metadata.
- **FR-011**: Email subject, body, links and attachments MUST be treated as untrusted evidence. No instruction contained in email content may alter the recipe, policy or tool authorization.
- **FR-011a**: The authenticated server MUST resolve exactly one active Gmail row for the selected owner and exact account label, then save the row's connection ID and cached email as structured expected identity in the bot. Client text, instructions, and cached inventory are not live proof. Missing, ambiguous, foreign, revoked, or email-less selections MUST fail closed.
- **FR-011b**: A Jev bot run MUST use a distinct, bounded recipe capability tied to owner, run, agent revision, and saved account after restricted execution is proven. Generic integration/Jev endpoints MUST reject that capability; ordinary agents retain their existing permission and approval behavior. Until then, the canonical server MUST reject even bound Jev invocations before creating a Run or launching a harness. Legacy Jev bots without a binding remain readable but cannot execute the recipe until their owner explicitly reselects an account and the broker is available.
- **FR-011c**: Before any mailbox search/read or funded Jev evaluation, the server MUST recheck the current bot/account binding and call Gmail `get_profile` for the pinned connection. The live `emailAddress` MUST exactly match the saved expected email. Missing, ambiguous, mismatched, revoked, or changed identity stops before mailbox search/read and Jev dispatch. The same selected connection MUST be used for profile and requested read; the model cannot supply a verified flag.
- **FR-012**: The skill MUST process only new or content-changed threads when reliable Gmail history and content fingerprints are available.
- **FR-013**: The skill MUST use a snippet first pass and MUST fetch bounded full context when cold outreach, urgency or reply evidence crosses the configured verification trigger.
- **FR-014**: Full verification MUST use no more than the latest four messages, ordered oldest to newest, with bounded cleaned text and relevant metadata.
- **FR-015**: Triage categories MUST be multi-label. The skill MUST use deterministic thresholds maintained outside model output.
- **FR-016**: An authorized cold-outreach archive proposal MUST require verified full-message classification, the strict archive threshold and no conflicting urgent, needs-reply, personal, investment or recruiting signal. Archive means removing only `INBOX`; classification alone never performs the mutation.
- **FR-017**: The workflow MUST never send, reply, forward, trash or delete email.
- **FR-018**: The first release acceptance run MUST be read-only. Any later mailbox mutation MUST occur only under explicit, action-specific user authorization or an existing automation authorization that covers the action. A Jev result is never authorization.
- **FR-019**: Classification, verification or integration failure MUST cause no Gmail changes for that thread.
- **FR-020**: Gmail label creation and message modification MUST be idempotent and use existing Matrix integration actions.
- **FR-021**: The bundled skill MUST be discoverable through the existing Matrix skill distribution path and MUST use the shared Matrix Jev tool rather than implement a second HTTP client.
- **FR-022**: Only coding agents with verified skill discovery, tool registration and real invocation MAY be advertised as supported.
- **FR-023**: User-visible activity MUST distinguish Jev success, review/abstention, unavailable service and downstream Gmail actions.
- **FR-024**: Public documentation MUST explain Gateway-funded Jev access, unchanged primary-model selection, Gmail permissions, labels, archive behavior and recovery from unavailable states.

## Key entities

- **Jev recipe**: An immutable server-owned name/version containing typed questions and response validation.
- **Triage request**: Owner-scoped recipe invocation with bounded state and an idempotency key.
- **Triage result**: Validated probabilities and operational metadata for one recipe execution.
- **Thread fingerprint**: Stable digest of the bounded Gmail thread content and recipe version used to prevent duplicate work.
- **Triage policy**: Deterministic verification, label, Review and archive thresholds maintained by the skill.

## Success criteria

- **SC-001**: A supported agent classifies a controlled Gmail inbox end to end using one Jev request per evaluated state and returns all seven probabilities.
- **SC-002**: Fixture tests cover every label, overlapping labels, each Review path and the strict archive gate with 100% deterministic-policy branch coverage.
- **SC-003**: First-release duplicate invocation tests demonstrate one upstream dispatch for the same owner, thread, recipe and fingerprint, with zero Gmail mutations. Any future authorized write requires its own idempotency evidence.
- **SC-004**: Owner isolation, disabled policy, zero credit, malformed response, timeout and unavailable-upstream tests make no Gmail mutations and expose only safe errors.
- **SC-005**: A personal-primary-model acceptance run completes Jev triage through Matrix AI without changing primary provider settings.
- **SC-006**: Normal logs contain no raw fixture body or credentials; observability still identifies recipe, request, latency, status and usage/cost outcome.
- **SC-007**: First-release exact-head evidence shows owner-matched bounded reads, proposed labels, Review/failure behavior, and zero Gmail mutations. An authorized archive demo is a separately requested later milestone.
- **SC-008**: The implementation, tests, public documentation and demo evidence pass required CI and review gates before release.

## Assumptions

- Gmail is already connected through Matrix integrations; adding a new mail provider or OAuth flow is outside this feature.
- Matrix's existing funded runtime credential and control-plane accounting remain the authority for Jev eligibility and credits.
- Cloudflare's AI REST API exposes `typesafe/jev` through `POST /ai/run`, accepts one state with several Noul questions and returns typed answers plus token usage.
- Jev settlement uses the reviewed TypeSafe input-token price with a short expiry horizon; missing usage or expired pricing follows conservative reconciliation.
- The first public demo may use a controlled test mailbox. Production mailbox mutation still requires the same authorization rules.

## Non-goals

- Personal provider keys, user-selected Jev endpoints or a Jev credential settings page.
- Research-shortlist and task-routing recipes.
- A generic `use-jevs` custom-workflow product, arbitrary user-authored recipes or a new workflow engine.
- Jev Ultrafast, browser/computer use and native Matrix OS navigation.
- Sending, replying, forwarding, trashing or deleting email.
- Advertising universal agent support or unmeasured speed/token-saving claims.

## Dependencies and release boundary

Implementation reuses the existing Gmail integration actions, Matrix skill distribution, runtime authentication and funded AI admission/settlement. Source inspection on 2026-09-22 found no Jev code on current `main`; this feature therefore adds the narrow evaluation path while preserving existing chat-model behavior.

Availability remains gated until a real owner-scoped call, credit settlement and supported-agent invocation pass. This specification authorizes implementation and review, not production deployment.
