description: Spin up, observe, and tear down Matrix OS preview environments — per-PR preview VPSes, platform Cloud Run preview revisions, HMR staging slots — and query their centralized logs. Use when a change needs to be seen running (shell/gateway/onboarding/CLI/macOS features), when asked to deploy a branch for testing, or when you need logs from any preview, staging, or fleet VPS.

# Preview Environments

Production Matrix OS is VPS-native + Cloud Run; previews mirror that. Full
reference: `docs/dev/preview-environments.md`. Spec: `specs/093-preview-environments/`.

## Pick the surface

| You changed | Use | How |
|---|---|---|
| Shell/gateway/kernel UI, fast iteration | **Staging slot** (HMR, seconds per change) | `./scripts/staging-slot.sh up <worktree>` |
| Shell/gateway/kernel, production-shaped verify; onboarding (needs virgin VPS) | **Preview VPS** | add the `preview-vps` label to the PR |
| Platform (packages/platform) | **Platform preview revision** | add the `preview-platform` label to the PR |
| macOS app | CI artifact + any preview VPS via `app.matrix-os.com/vm/<handle>` | build artifact from `macos-086.yml` |
| CLI | npm dist-tag paired with a preview VPS profile | see docs |

## Staging slots (inner loop)

Run from the ops VPS, repo root or any checkout:

```bash
./scripts/staging-slot.sh up ~/matrix-os.worktrees/<branch>   # claims slot N
# -> https://staging-<N>.matrix-os.com (HMR: edits in the worktree hot-reload)
./scripts/staging-slot.sh status            # who owns what
./scripts/staging-slot.sh down <N>          # release when done — slots are shared!
```

4 slots max. Always `down` your slot when finished; `status --reap` frees slots
idle past TTL.

## Preview VPS (verify loop)

Label the PR `preview-vps`. CI builds bundle `v<YYYY.MM.DD>-pr<N>-<run>-<attempt>-<sha7>`,
registers it **without any channel** (it can never reach real users), provisions VPS `pr-<N>`,
deploys, and comments the URL. Closed PR ⇒ VPS deleted (daily reaper as backstop,
72h TTL). Manual run: `gh workflow run preview-vps.yml -f pr=<N>`.

The shared `pr-<N>` VPS cannot use personal Integrations or Custom MCP. To test a PR
against your own connected accounts, an internal member runs `matrix preview start <N>`
for an owner-only Private Preview (see `docs/dev/preview-environments.md`).

## Logs — one interface for everything

```bash
./scripts/preview-logs.sh --handle pr-123 [--unit matrix-gateway] [--grep ERROR] [--since 1h]
./scripts/preview-logs.sh --slot 2 --since 30m
./scripts/preview-logs.sh --selector '{env="preview"}' --grep "unhandled"
```

Runs against the central Loki (loopback on the ops VPS). Slot logs ship
automatically (promtail docker discovery). A preview/fleet VPS ships logs after
one-time enrollment:

```bash
PLATFORM_SECRET=... LOGS_INGEST_USER=fleet LOGS_INGEST_PASSWORD=... \
  ./scripts/enable-vps-logship.sh pr-123 preview
```

(`LOGS_INGEST_*` live in `~/matrix-os/.env` on the ops VPS.)

## Rules

- Never promote a preview bundle to a channel; never deploy channel-wide from a PR.
- Never point a preview at production secrets or the production platform service.
- Tear down what you spin up: `staging-slot.sh down`, close the PR, or delete the
  VPS via `DELETE /vps/<machineId>` — never directly in Hetzner.
- Browser-level inspection: drive the preview URL with Playwright/chrome-devtools
  MCP; passive browser-log forwarding is deferred (spec 093).
