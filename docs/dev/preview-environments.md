# Preview Environments

How to see a change running, production-shaped, and read its logs — for humans
and coding agents. Spec: `specs/093-preview-environments/`.

Production Matrix OS is VPS-native per user (host systemd services from a host
bundle) with the platform on Cloud Run. Previews mirror that architecture
instead of approximating it with local containers. All previews ship logs to
the central Loki on the ops VPS, queryable through one script.

## Decision table

| Feature type | Surface | Latency per change | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shell/gateway UI iteration | Staging slot (HMR) | seconds | none (ops VPS) |
| Shell/gateway/kernel verification | Preview VPS | ~20 min (bundle build + deploy) | 1 small Hetzner VPS until PR close |
| Onboarding flows | Preview VPS (virgin by construction) | ~20 min | same |
| Platform changes | Cloud Run preview revision | ~10 min | Cloud Run free-tier-ish |
| Personal Integrations / Custom MCP against a PR | Private Preview | ~20 min | 1 small Hetzner VPS for at most 72h |
| macOS app | CI artifact + preview VPS runtime | n/a | none extra |
| CLI beta x shell | npm dist-tag + preview VPS profile | minutes | none extra |

## Staging slots — the inner loop

Four hot-reloading dev containers on the ops VPS behind the existing tunnel,
one per git worktree:

```bash
./scripts/staging-slot.sh up ~/matrix-os.worktrees/my-feature
# claimed slot 2:
#   shell: https://staging-2.matrix-os.com
#   api:   https://api-staging-2.matrix-os.com
```

Edits in the worktree hit Turbopack/`tsx watch` directly — no rebuild. Each
slot gets its own database (`matrixos_staging_<n>` on the dedicated staging
postgres) and its own named volumes. Slot ownership lives in
`~/.matrixos/staging-slots/`; claims are race-safe (`O_EXCL`).

- `staging-slot.sh status` — list owners; `status --reap` frees slots idle past
  `STAGING_SLOT_TTL_HOURS` (default 72).
- `staging-slot.sh down <n>` — release. Slots are a shared resource; release
  them when done.
- `staging-slot.sh logs <n> -f` — raw compose logs; or use `preview-logs.sh
  --slot <n>` (slot containers ship to Loki automatically via the
  observability promtail's docker discovery).

## Preview VPS — the verify loop

### Per-PR hostname migration

The target browser URL is `https://pr-<N>.preview.matrix-os.com`. A dedicated
Preview edge Worker is prepared to route the exact hostname to the matching
tagged revision of `matrix-platform-preview`; `preview.matrix-os.com` can then
become the stable entry host. **Do not deploy its wildcard route yet.** The current
`preview-vps` workflow still provisions under the production platform, and
the share connector still uses production Clerk identities. Keep using the
current `/vm/pr-<N>` URL until the Preview-owned VPS and separate identity
path in [spec 530](../../specs/530-per-pr-preview-hostnames/spec.md) is complete.

The platform workflow still uses a shared staging database, secrets, and
service account across PR revisions. Before activating the new route, give
each PR its own database, service identity, secrets, and VPS; provision a
separate Preview Clerk instance, proxied wildcard DNS, and TLS coverage for
the deeper `*.preview.matrix-os.com` subdomains. Audit parent-domain cookies
and CSRF boundaries before exposing unmerged PR JavaScript at this hostname.

### Host configuration safety

Preview host configuration changes must preserve the existing file owner,
group, and mode across atomic replacement. The service wrapper runs as the
runtime user and sources `/opt/matrix/env/host.env`; a root-only replacement
can prevent the gateway from starting even when its values are correct. Check
metadata and readability as the service user before restarting anything, retain
a bounded rollback copy, and verify local health immediately afterward. Never
print the file contents or use a reboot as a substitute for restoring access.
If the gateway is unavailable, use an explicitly authorized operator connection;
do not recreate the preview or affect production machines to repair it.

### Provisioning workflow

Add the **`preview-vps`** label to a same-repo PR. The `Preview VPS` workflow:

1. Builds the host bundle as `v<YYYY.MM.DD>-pr<N>-<run>-<attempt>-<sha7>` (re-runs
   on every push while the label is present).
2. Publishes it **register-only** (`publish-release.sh --channel none`): the
   release exists in R2 + platform DB but no channel pointer can ever select
   it, so it cannot reach real users.
3. Provisions VPS `pr-<N>` (runtime slot `pr-<N>`, owned by the
   `PREVIEW_CLERK_USER_ID` Clerk user and shared only with the bounded
   `PREVIEW_CLERK_ACCESS_USER_IDS` allowlist) if absent, then deploys exactly
   that version to exactly that handle. Shared access applies only to
   server-classified preview machines; customer and primary runtimes remain
   owner-only.
4. Comments the URL on the PR: `https://app.matrix-os.com/vm/pr-<N>`.

Teardown is automatic on PR close. A daily reaper deletes any `pr-*` VPS whose
PR is closed or that is older than 72h — orphaned previews cannot accumulate
Hetzner cost. The reaper is fail-safe: a VPS whose PR state cannot be confirmed
is skipped, and the job fails so the skip is visible. Manual deploy: `gh workflow run preview-vps.yml -f pr=<N>`.

Required repo secrets (beyond the existing release secrets):
`PREVIEW_CLERK_USER_ID` — the Clerk user that owns preview VPSes.
`PREVIEW_CLERK_ACCESS_USER_IDS` — optional JSON array of up to eight additional
Clerk user IDs allowed to open the same preview VPSes. The owner must not be
repeated in this list. Re-running the workflow replaces the preview allowlist
with the configured value without recreating the VPS. Removing a collaborator
blocks subsequent HTTP requests and new WebSocket handshakes after that deploy.
An already-established WebSocket remains connected until it disconnects or is
closed; active connection draining is intentionally deferred.

Preview VPSes cannot use machine-proxied personal Integrations or Custom MCP
accounts. A collaborator with a shared Terminal can read the machine credential,
so the platform rejects personal-account requests on both internal routes,
including requests claiming the owner or another collaborator. An isolated
platform-preview Custom MCP fixture uses a synthetic owner and remains available.
Personal integrations remain
available through the platform's Clerk-authenticated routes under each actor's own
account. Use synthetic fixtures for in-VPS integration acceptance tests on a
shared Preview VPS. To test a PR against your own connected accounts, use a
[Private Preview](#private-preview--your-own-accounts-on-a-pr) instead.

### Shared preview Terminal authorization

The platform database machine record is authoritative for preview classification
and `accessClerkUserIds`. The machine retains one canonical owner. Each browser
request and WebSocket token retains the authenticated collaborator's Clerk ID.
No allowlist is copied into VPS configuration.

For `/api/terminal/*` and `/ws/terminal/tab`, the platform adds a compact,
HMAC-SHA256 signed `x-platform-preview-terminal` access decision only after checking
the current preview classification and allowlist. The existing verified identity
headers continue to carry the real actor. The terminal access signature binds that
actor to the canonical owner and runtime slot; its existing per-handle signing key
also binds it to the exact preview handle. HTTP and WebSocket proxies strip incoming
platform identity and terminal-access headers before creating their own. The
gateway verifies the signature, authenticated actor, configured owner, and exact
runtime slot. Preview classification remains a server-side platform decision, not
a client header or a classification inferred solely from a `pr-*` name. Customer
records cannot issue terminal access, including records with preview-shaped names.

Terminal workspaces, project fences, and attachment capabilities continue to use
canonical resource ownership. Authentication, Chat authorization, and terminal
audit data retain the real actor. The same gateway owner/access
guard protects HTTP discovery/mutations and WebSocket attachment. Invalid proofs
provide no additional authority and retain the generic denial behavior. The
browser keeps the `/vm/pr-<N>` prefix on API, token, and WebSocket URLs.

Allowlist changes apply on the next proxied request or handshake. Active-stream
revocation, changes to Chat permissions, and sharing of
other owner-only APIs are outside this fix. There are no new DB writes, caches,
clocks, background timers, or persisted authorization state. Existing terminal lifecycle,
project transaction/fencing, and shutdown behavior remain in effect.

Rollout requires both the platform routing service and the preview VPS gateway
host bundle. Publishing only a host bundle leaves the old platform token/proof
behavior in place. Install both before validating the browser workflow with an
allowlisted collaborator; ordinary customer VPS access remains owner-only.

Preview provisioning uses the operator-only `/vps/preview/provision` route with the
same `pr-<N>` value for the handle and runtime slot. A `202` is valid only when its
machine ID is immediately visible as `provisioning` or `running` in `/vps/fleet`.
Rerunning the workflow resumes that exact machine; an absent or failed preview is
retried through the same idempotent route. The platform persists the machine and a
durable provisioning job atomically before provider dispatch.

Golden-snapshot rollout validation may additionally supply one exact
`testSnapshotId`. That optional field is accepted only with the separate snapshot
operator bearer, only for a ready test-mode image, and fails closed rather than
falling back to a clean image. Normal preview automation continues to use the
platform bearer and cannot opt into this path.

To walk the full onboarding/billing flow against branch platform code — a
four-slice split (staging slot for the shell, an IAM-proxied `preview-platform`
revision for the journey/reliability API, a local `dev:platform` + Stripe CLI
for the test-mode checkout/webhook race, and a disposable feature VPS for the
provisioned hand-off) — see the `staging-platform-vps` command and
[Staging Platform and Feature VPS Runbook](staging-platform-vps.md).

## Private Preview — your own accounts on a PR

A Private Preview runs one same-repository PR's published bundle on a machine
that only you can reach, under your own Matrix account. Because nobody else can
reach it, it can use your personal Integrations and Custom MCP from Settings,
Chat agents, and Terminal agent CLIs. Spec:
[537](../../specs/537-private-preview/spec.md).

Who can use it: members of the internal Clerk organization named by
`MATRIX_INTERNAL_CLERK_ORG_ID`. Membership is read through the collaboration
organization projection, so the platform needs collaboration configured; without
it the routes return 503 and personal accounts stay denied.

First give the PR a bundle: add the **`preview-bundle`** label (same-repository
PRs only). The Preview workflow builds the exact head, registers it without a
channel and with the PR number and author, and comments the version on the PR.
It rebuilds on every push while the label is on, and provisions nothing.
Bundles built for the `preview-vps` label also qualify.

```bash
matrix preview start 1907    # shows the PR's newest bundle, commit, and author; asks to confirm
matrix preview list          # handle, status, confirmed version, expiry, URL
matrix preview update 1907   # moves to the PR's newest bundle after confirming
matrix preview destroy 1907
```

Open it at `https://app.matrix-os.com/vm/<handle>`; the handle looks like
`pv-1907-3fa91c2e`. Pass `--yes` to confirm without a prompt and `--json` for
machine-readable output.

What keeps it safe:

- Only you: no collaborators, no Preview Terminal grants, and the platform
  refuses collaboration registration and tickets for it.
- Only the code you confirmed: it installs only the exact bundle version you
  confirmed. Its update base serves no other version and no channel manifest,
  and operator, fleet, and PR workflow deploys skip it. New commits on the PR
  never deploy themselves; run `matrix preview update`.
- Only while eligible: personal accounts work only while the machine is running,
  younger than 72 hours, and you are still a current internal member. Otherwise
  the platform denies them on every request.
- Cleanup: the platform destroys it after 72 hours or when you leave the
  organization. When a PR with either preview label closes, the Preview
  workflow destroys its Private Previews, and the daily reaper catches any
  whose PR closed without that run.

It still runs the PR's unmerged code as your production account, much like
running the branch locally with your own credentials. Only start it for PRs
whose code you would run that way. Its shell is served on the production origin
until spec 530 isolates Preview origins (#1951).

Limits: two active Private Previews per person by default
(`MATRIX_PRIVATE_PREVIEW_LIMIT`, at most four) and one per PR. Starting the same
PR again shows the existing machine, and points to `matrix preview update` when
it is on an older bundle; a failed one must be destroyed first. Private Previews
cannot be recovered; destroy and start again.

`matrix preview update` records your confirmation before asking the machine to
install, so a matching version means confirmed, not necessarily installed. If
the machine is not on it, run `matrix preview update <pr>` again and accept the
offer to install it again (or pass `--yes`).

Custom MCP servers reach a Private Preview by a push when you change them, a
pull when it starts, and a pull every five minutes that catches anything it
missed. Tool calls from it are still checked against your primary computer, so
keep that running while you test Custom MCP.

Bundles need PR provenance. A bundle registered without a PR number cannot be
started as a Private Preview. `preview-bundle` builds always carry it, using the
release scripts from `main`. `preview-vps` builds carry it once the PR branch
includes the provenance flags, so rebase an older branch or add
`preview-bundle`.

## Platform preview revisions

Add the **`preview-platform`** label. The workflow (bound to the GitHub
`Preview` environment) deploys the platform image to the dedicated
`matrix-platform-preview` Cloud Run service as a zero-traffic tagged revision
(`https://pr-<N>---<service-url>`). It runs as the dedicated
`matrix-platform-preview-runner` SA, which can read only: the **staging**
database (`platform-database-url-staging` — previews share it; Neon branch
per PR is deferred, spec 093), preview-generated platform/JWT/edge-router
secrets, the Clerk keys, the R2 bundles credentials (required by
`CUSTOMER_VPS_ENABLED=true` boot validation), and **Stripe TEST-mode** secrets.
Production `CLOUD_RUN_SERVICE`, its runtime SA, its database, and live Stripe
keys are never referenced. No Hetzner token is mounted, so a preview platform
cannot provision real VPSes. Provider-disabled revisions marked
`PLATFORM_PREVIEW=true` therefore skip the production primary-sync-storage
startup invariant; mounting a Hetzner token immediately restores that fail-closed
canonical EU R2 check. On PR close the workflow removes the `pr-<N>` tag
and deletes its revisions, mirroring the VPS teardown model.

**Browser-reachable onboarding/billing.** The service runs with public ingress
(`--allow-unauthenticated`, exactly like production — the app enforces its own
Clerk/JWT auth, the operator API stays gated by the preview `PLATFORM_SECRET`)
and is fronted by **`https://preview.matrix-os.com`**. So a labelled PR can be
walked end to end in a browser before merge: sign in → plan → Stripe **test**
checkout (`4242 4242 4242 4242`) → settling → journey. Origins/redirects
resolve to the preview host (`MATRIX_APP_URL`/`PLATFORM_PUBLIC_URL`).
Bearer-returning desktop control-plane calls use the separate preview Cloud Run
service origin published as `PREVIEW_API_ORIGIN`; it must never alias the
browser-reachable preview host.

Previews are still per-PR tagged, zero-traffic revisions, so point the host at
the PR you want to walk, then reset:

```bash
gcloud run services update-traffic matrix-platform-preview \
  --region europe-west3 --to-tags pr-<N>=100      # walk this PR
```

The host serves whichever PR tag currently holds traffic, so switching to
another PR is just another `--to-tags pr-<M>=100` (no separate reset needed).
Avoid `--to-latest` here — on this service "latest" is the most recently
*deployed* PR revision, not a stable base, so it would leave the host pinned to
whatever deployed last. To park the host on a known-good target, point traffic
at an explicit revision/tag you designate as the resting state.

Provisioning the boot→ready hand-off in the browser is still out of scope (no
Hetzner token on preview); enabling it is a deliberate follow-up (a
preview-scoped Hetzner token + VPS reaping). For that slice today, use the
feature-VPS path in [Staging Platform and Feature VPS Runbook](staging-platform-vps.md).

### One-time infrastructure setup

The label workflow assumes this is already provisioned in GCP/Cloudflare/Stripe
(run by an owner with the relevant access — the workflow only deploys):

1. **Stripe test secrets** in Secret Manager (test mode only):
   `stripe-secret-key-test`, `stripe-webhook-secret-test`,
   `stripe-price-matrix-{starter,builder,max}-{monthly,annual}-test`.
2. **Routing** `preview.matrix-os.com` → the `matrix-platform-preview` run.app
   origin (`matrix-platform-preview-<hash>-ey.a.run.app`) via Cloudflare, the
   **same mechanism app/api.matrix-os.com use** (Cloud Run domain mappings are
   not available in `europe-west3`, so this is Cloudflare-proxied with the
   run.app Host header, not a GCP domain mapping). Because previews are tagged
   zero-traffic revisions, also route the PR under test to traffic
   (`update-traffic --to-tags pr-<N>=100`) so the base origin serves it.
3. **Stripe test webhook** → `https://preview.matrix-os.com/billing/webhooks/stripe`
   (`checkout.session.completed`, `.expired`, `customer.subscription.*`); store
   its signing secret as `stripe-webhook-secret-test`.
4. Grant `matrix-platform-preview-runner` `secretAccessor` on the new secrets.

The GitHub `Preview` environment may set `MATRIX_CARD_TRIALS_ENABLED` to
`true` or `false`; it defaults to `true`. Disable it temporarily for an immediate-
payment regression pass, then restore it after validation. `MATRIX_CARD_TRIAL_DAYS`
controls new trial offers, defaults to `3`, and must be an integer from `1`
through `30`. Each change
requires redeploying the preview revision. Existing Stripe trials and reserved
Checkout attempts retain their original duration, and billing status continues
to display that reserved duration until the attempt settles.

## Centralized logs

Everything funnels into the ops-VPS Loki and is queryable one way:

```bash
./scripts/preview-logs.sh --handle pr-123                      # whole VPS
./scripts/preview-logs.sh --handle pr-123 --unit matrix-gateway --grep ERROR
./scripts/preview-logs.sh --slot 2 --since 30m                 # staging slot
./scripts/preview-logs.sh --selector '{env="preview"}'         # everything preview
```

Runs against `http://127.0.0.1:3100` on the ops VPS (`LOKI_URL` to override).
Grafana (`grafana.matrix-os.com`) has the same Loki as a datasource for
dashboards.

### How logs get there

- **Staging slots / ops containers**: the observability promtail's docker
  discovery ships any container with `matrixos` in its name. Nothing to do.
- **VPSes (preview or fleet)**: Grafana Alloy, installed by
  `matrix-install-logship` (ships in the host bundle `bin/`). It tails the
  matrix systemd units and the kernel JSONL logs, labels streams with
  `handle` and `env`, and dual-writes to PostHog Logs via OTLP/HTTP plus the
  existing `https://logs.matrix-os.com` Loki ingest edge. Loki is retained only
  as the `preview-logs.sh` compatibility path until the self-hosted
  observability stack retirement slice removes it. Enroll a VPS once from the
  ops box:

  ```bash
  PLATFORM_SECRET=... LOGS_INGEST_USER=fleet LOGS_INGEST_PASSWORD=... POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN=<project-token> \
    ./scripts/enable-vps-logship.sh <handle> <preview|prod|staging>
  ```

  Credentials live in `~/matrix-os/.env`; the edge's bcrypt hash lives in
  `distro/observability/logs-edge/logs-edge.env` (gitignored; see the
  `.example`). Rotate by regenerating both and recreating `logs-edge`, then
  re-running enrollment.
- **Fleet auto-enrollment** (every new customer VPS ships logs from first
  boot) requires platform cloud-init templating and is deferred — spec 093.

## Operational notes

- The tunnel config (`distro/cloudflared.yml`) and observability compose are
  live, bind-mounted configs on the ops VPS — merged changes there must be
  applied by restarting the respective containers.
- Staging slot DNS (`staging-<1..4>`, `api-staging-<1..4>`, `logs`) was created
  once via `cloudflared tunnel route dns matrix-os <hostname>`.
- Preview bundles in R2 (`system-bundles/v*-pr*`) can be cleaned after PR
  close; they are never referenced by channel pointers. Keep any version that an
  active Private Preview still has confirmed.
